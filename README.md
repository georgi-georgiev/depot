Environment Variable Management: Enable the management and manipulation of environment variables within the testing environment. This includes setting, modifying, and removing environment variables as required for different test scenarios.

Isolation and Sandboxing: Create isolated and sandboxed environments for each test, ensuring that environment variables set during one test do not impact subsequent tests. This allows for independent and reproducible test executions.

Environment Variable Injection: Inject specific environment variables into the test environment to simulate different configurations or conditions. This enables the testing of specific scenarios or edge cases by controlling the values of environment variables.

Dynamic Environment Variable Updates: Support the dynamic updating of environment variable values during test execution. This allows for real-time modification of environment variables to observe the impact on the tested application.

Environment Variable Persistence: Provide the ability to persist environment variables across multiple test runs. This ensures that specific configurations or setups can be reused for subsequent tests without the need for manual reconfiguration.

Environment Variable Scoping: Allow for scoping environment variables to specific test cases, test suites, or test environments. This ensures that environment variables are only applicable and accessible to the relevant tests, reducing interference and improving test isolation.

Environment Variable Dependency Management: Support managing dependencies between environment variables, such as setting values based on the values of other environment variables or propagating values across multiple variables. This facilitates the creation of complex test setups.

Environment Variable Encryption: Provide the ability to encrypt sensitive environment variable values to ensure their secure storage and transmission. This helps protect sensitive data used in testing, such as credentials or access keys.

Environment Variable Versioning: Support versioning and tracking of environment variable configurations to enable reproducibility of tests and ensure consistent test results across different test runs or environments.

Integration with Testing Frameworks: Integrate seamlessly with popular testing frameworks, allowing for easy incorporation of environment variable management into test scripts and automation workflows.

Reporting and Logging: Provide logging and reporting capabilities to track and document changes made to environment variables during testing. This aids in troubleshooting, debugging, and analyzing test results.

Compatibility and Portability: Ensure compatibility and portability across different operating systems, containerization platforms, and development environments. This allows the tool to be used in a wide range of testing setups and configurations.
